/* Describe the long-named options requested by the application.
   The LONG_OPTIONS argument to getopt_long or getopt_long_only is a vector
   of `struct option' terminated by an element containing a name which is
   zero.

   The field `has_arg' is:
   no_argument		(or 0) if the option does not take an argument,
   required_argument	(or 1) if the option requires an argument,
   optional_argument 	(or 2) if the option takes an optional argument.

   If the field `flag' is not NULL, it points to a variable that is set
   to the value given in the field `val' when the option is found, but
   left unchanged if the option is not found.

   To have a long-named option do something other than set an `int' to
   a compiled-in constant, such as set a value from `optarg', set the
   option's `flag' field to zero and its `val' field to a nonzero
   value (the equivalent single-letter option character, if there is
   one).  For long options that have a zero `flag' field, `getopt'
   returns the contents of the `val' field.  */

/* Functions to process the arguments in ARGV (ARGC of them, minus the
   program name) for options given in OPTS.

   Return the option character from OPTS just read.  Return -1 when
   there are no more options.  For unrecognized options, or options
   missing arguments, `optopt' is set to the option letter, and '?' is
   returned.

   The OPTS string is a list of characters which are recognized option
   letters, optionally followed by colons, specifying that that letter
   takes an argument, to be placed in `optarg'.

   If a letter in OPTS is followed by two colons, its argument is
   optional.  This behavior is specific to the GNU `getopt'.

   The argument `--' causes premature termination of argument
   scanning, explicitly telling `getopt' that there are no more
   options.

   If OPTS begins with `--', then non-option arguments are treated as
   arguments to the option '\0'.  This behavior is specific to the GNU
   `getopt'.  */
